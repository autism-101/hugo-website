[{"categories":null,"contents":"“See If You’re On The Spectrum!” read a link on social media. I was bored so I clicked on the link. It took me to an autism screening test called, The Autism Spectrum Quotient or AQ for short. The test consists of 50 questions. The average score people get is around 16. Eighty percent of those diagnosed with autism score 32 percent or higher. So I took the test. At the end it computes your score. Out came my result…43!\nThis test is flawed!!\nMy Reaction To My Test Results\nWhaaaat??? I was incredulous. “This test is flawed!!”, I said to myself. So I went searching for other online autism screening tests and took those like the RAADS-R. All of them came back the same. “You should get tested for autism”, they all said. So I started researching autism. The only thing I knew about it was from watching tv or movies. Autistic savants like in the movie Rain Man was what I thought autism was. Spoiler alert, I’m not a savant. After reading about the main characteristics of autism and the actual diagnosis criteria found in the DSM-V I knew the tests were correct.\nIn this past year I have been diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD). In addition, I deal with SDAM[1], aphantasia[2], insomnia, misophonia[3], and alexithymia[4].\nBut remember, you haven\u0026rsquo;t changed.\nFamily and Friends\nI have had both family and friends tell me, “but remember, you haven’t changed”. But that’s not true. I have changed, and I’ve changed a lot! How I view my whole life history has changed. My understanding of who I am and my identity has changed. My family and friends whom I have disclosed my diagnosis to have changed as well. Now my “quirks” are more clearly understood. And I have finally found answers to the many questions I have had about myself my entire life.\nLearning From Other Autistics In addition, I now have an entire community of other autistic people I can hang out with online who experience things like I do. And they have been teaching me how to take better care of myself. I also have found a whole new set of special interests for me to enjoy.\nTalk about change.

While at a movie or concert I often resort to putting both of my hands over my ears. I will look around and wonder why I am the only one in this large group of people that it bothers. How can they not hear how LOUD it is? Sensitivity to sounds also affects our sleep at night. Many of us suffer from insomnia.\nI’m also sensitive to light and prefer to sit in the dark. Since I work from home, I will go through the house and turn off all of the lights when my family leaves for the day. I use dark-mode on my computer and I reverse black and white colors by using a black background with green or white text.\nMany Autistic people have to deal with sensory issues. Since each person is unique, there can be different reactions to similar sensory inputs. Some experience hypersensitivity while others hyposensitivity (under-responsiveness), and still others a mixture of both. Sensory issues are also cited as a requirement for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the DSM-V.\nHyper- or hypo- reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment.\nDSM-5\nSensory issues can affect any of our eight senses: visual (sight), auditory (sounds), olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile (touch), and the three senses that often get left out, vestibular (balance), proprioception (sensations from muscles/joints), and interoception (internal sensations like thirst and hunger).\nLearning What Works For You Each individual autistic must learn what works best for them to manage their sensory issues. There are products that offer help for more common issues. For example, the advent of noise cancelling headphones has been a godsend for autistic people. We can now eliminate all of the external sounds that can be so intrusive to us. There are also ear plugs that can filter a lot of background sounds. And some soft ones designed to be worn while sleeping at night. There are sunglasses that help with bright light and weighted blankets that provide sleep support as well as reducing anxiety.\n","date":"June 5, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-4_hu29c327de23bd7b2fdbef79c7b406827f_339444_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/autism-blog/autism-and-sensory-issues/","title":"Autism and Sensory Issues"},{"categories":null,"contents":"There are many routines that I find myself doing. From wearing the same grey shirt every day to eating the same food. I will listen to the same song on repeat for days at a time.\nDiagnostic Criteria One of the primary diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as described in the DSM-5 is that the individual shows restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.\nWe prefer to have our daily routines so that we know what is going to happen each day.\nSurviving Chaos I think the reason we engage in these behaviors is that to an autistic person the world is a very unpredictable and often confusing place. We prefer to have our daily routines so that we know what is going to happen each day. For me that includes things like traveling the same route to and from a common destination, or eating exactly the same food for breakfast. These routines and sameness help me navigate a chaotic and uncertain world.\n","date":"April 16, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-3_hu0ffa119e59e5067f86765bedf83f9d3f_33166_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/autism-blog/autism-and-routines/","title":"Autism and Routines"},{"categories":null,"contents":"One Autistic trait that I have is the ability to hyperfocus on something that I am really interested in. While many Autistic people share this ability not all of us do. I’m reminded of a saying we like to use, “If you’ve met one Autistic person, you’ve met one Autistic person”. This means that we are all different, and though we might have some shared characteristics, many could be different.\nLearning New Skills I’ve used the ability to hyperfocus to learn new skills in a really short amount of time. I will typically bombard my brain 24-7 with the new information I am trying to learn. I am able to deeply concentrate to the point where everything outside of what I’m doing simply fades away. This has enabled me to accomplish many important goals in my life. One example is that I was able to completely change my career in less than six months.\nSome Drawbacks However, it is not without its drawbacks. Being in a state of hyperfocus means I often can’t respond when someone is trying to get my attention. This means I may appear to be rude or aloof. When I was in college and was walking across the campus, I would often be lost in thought. People would tell me that they saw me walking and had hollered out my name and tried to get my attention but I didn’t respond. This is an example where my hyperfocusing affected someone’s opinion of me or worse, caused hurt feelings.\nAutism in the Media The media likes to share stories about Autistic people with extraordinary abilities in math, science, or the arts. This sort of focus tends to minimize the real struggles Autistic people have by implying we all have some great gift we can rely on. Some Autistic people may have unique gifts but many of us do not. I happen to be one of the lucky ones in that regard, but many are not. Yes, some Autistic people may talk about an ability they have as their “super-power” but please don’t get the wrong idea. If the stereotype of the Autistic savant with an extraordinary ability continues to be the main narrative pushed by the media, it can be used to minimize the real struggles Autistic people go through every day.\n","date":"April 2, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-1_hufdb9bb88432846b1ebccf10840943453_362306_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/autism-blog/autism-and-hyperfocus/","title":"Autism and Hyperfocus"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I got my Autistic diagnosis late last year as an older adult. Many years prior I was a piano teacher with my own piano studio. I had many types of students, from beginners to advanced and I taught both young and old. Two of my younger students had disabilities. One was an Autistic boy I’ll call Steven and the other a blind girl I’ll call Olivia. I had an immediate connection with both students. We just seemed to be in sync. I had never taught anyone with a disability before, but I seemed to intuitively know how best to go about teaching them. Looking back at it now I realize that my own Autistic communication system was somehow in sync with both of theirs.\nSteven I always knew when Steven had arrived at our home for his lesson because I’d hear ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong\u0026hellip;knock-knock-knock-knock at the door. I’d welcome Steven and his Mother into our home and after catching up for a bit, Steven and I would head to the piano. Steven was a lot of fun to teach. He could speak, but a lot of his speech consisted of cartoon phrases he had learned from television.\nOh well, back to the drawing board!\nSteven\nFor instance, if he made a mistake while playing a piece he might say, “Oh well, back to the drawing board.” or, “That’s despicable!”. Steven always played with great accuracy because of his musical ear and ability to memorize his pieces quickly. He would first listen to me play a new piece for him and then we would begin working on it together. At the end of each lesson we would play his favorite musical game which consisted of me playing chords on the piano for him to identify by ear. He would instantly tell me if a chord was major, minor, diminished, or augmented and would use the correct technical term when identifying them.\nOlivia I would drive over to Olivia’s house each week for her piano lesson. She would greet me at the door eager for the lesson to begin. I always brought with me a recording I had prepared for her to use for that weeks practice. I recorded any new songs for her to listen to with instructions on how to practice them. She would lead me to the piano where we would begin. Olivia had an amazing ear and memory. She would rock back and forth on the piano bench as she played through her pieces with great musical understanding. She also enjoyed composing her own music. Sometimes she had written lyrics for her composition and would sing along while she played for me. I would always encourage her to compose more.\n","date":"April 2, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-2_huf6f0ac947ab78cae940c8e88ec9c8007_129508_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/autism-blog/autism-in-sync/","title":"In Sync - connecting with the disabled"},{"categories":null,"contents":"About: Autastic exists as a home for the uncounted legion of adults worldwide who learned, well into adulthood, that they are (or might be) autistic.

A common response autistic people get when disclosing they are autistic, is for the other person to remark on how \u0026ldquo;high-functioning\u0026rdquo; they are. It is implied that this is much better than being \u0026ldquo;low-functioning\u0026rdquo;, and that their autism can\u0026rsquo;t really be that bad. Because hey, isn\u0026rsquo;t everybody on the spectrum somewhere?\nThese \u0026ldquo;functioning labels\u0026rdquo; are harmful to autistic people and have been used in the past to keep us from receiving services we need.\nHere is what three autistic people have to say:\nWhen I take the very vulnerable risk of disclosing to someone that I have autism, especially if it’s a person who is socially progressive or in a field working with autistic individuals, it really hurts me to have them respond by bragging on how high-functioning I am. It’s like a paradigm in our relationship suddenly shifted, where I’m an other—a case study or a set of symptoms instead of a human being. I don’t understand why it’s considered acceptable to comment on how appropriately someone is existing in the world. \u0026ndash;Isaac, musician\nI think that high-functioning is what people say when they cannot immediately see that you are autistic. Or say, when things are ok with you, that you are living within fictitious NT boundaries of normal behaviour. I hate the idea of this. It sounds to me like, “You are just about okay, unlike the rest of them!” I am very, very autistic. I have a degree and am good at various things, but this does not make me high-functioning. I struggle a lot with everyday life as do all autistic people. IQ is not a measure of autism. \u0026ndash;Leo Yeats, artist, UK\nHearing the “high-functioning” label is invalidating because it dismisses the sheer cost that “functioning” can have for someone with autism. I may be lucky enough to be able to work, but putting on an act that I’m not autistic all day professionally means that for the rest of the week I have no energy left for cooking, hobbies, or talking to anyone. I work three days a week, and spend the other four recovering and isolating from everyone I know just to do it again. That’s not functioning. That’s surviving. \u0026ndash;Rebekah, NSW, Australia[1]\nKat Williams in her National Center for Mental Health article writes:\nFunctioning labels, though not a diagnostic tool, are allocated arbitrarily to identify someone’s communication methods and intellectual ability: those labelled ‘high functioning’ typically have no speech or language delay (or the delay is not significant), communicate through speech, and have normal to high intellect; and those labelled ‘low functioning’ typically do not use spoken language, instead using an alternative form of communication such as a picture exchange system (PECS), sign, or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), and/or have an intellectual disability.\nFor those labelled high functioning, it can be incredibly difficult to get external support once diagnosed.\n\u0026lsquo;High functioning’ is not how an autistic person experiences being autistic, it’s how society experiences the autistic person. \u0026ndash;Kat Williams, 2019[2]\nDSM-V The American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) in 2013. In the United States and many other countries, the DSM-V is the reference guide healthcare professionals use to diagnose autism and other mental and behavioral conditions. It contains three different severity levels[3] of autism with the highest level three requiring \u0026ldquo;very substantial support\u0026rdquo;.\nProblems With Functioning Labels Labels Don\u0026rsquo;t Reflect Reality: Autistic people\u0026rsquo;s abilities to function constantly change. Everyone has had a bad day where they can barely do anything. Autistic people are no different, and their abilities to function often fluctuate dramatically during a single day. Labels Limit Who Gets Accomodations: Unless you are considered \u0026ldquo;low functioning\u0026rdquo; then automatically your accomodation needs will get ignored. It assumes \u0026ldquo;low functioning\u0026rdquo; people lack intelligence so they get denied opportunities, and \u0026ldquo;high functioning\u0026rdquo; people are assumed to be normal and denied support. Labels Are Not Helpful: Slapping a label on someone does not tell you anything useful about their specific needs. Labels Are Often Ableist: Instead of accepting people how they are, people are taught to believe being disabled is bad. So being labeled \u0026ldquo;high functioning\u0026rdquo; must be much better than \u0026ldquo;low functioning\u0026rdquo;. Labels Divide Us: People can use labels as a means to silence autistic voices they don\u0026rsquo;t approve of. Studies Show Functioning Labels Are Harmful Recent studies have shown that:\nHigh cognitive “function” had no connection to high function in other areas of life — an autistic person with high cognitive abilities can struggle significantly socially or emotionally. \u0026ndash;Dr. Gail Alvares, 2019[4]\nIn 2022 People Are Still Trying To Use Them The National Council On Severe Autism (NCSA) wants to add a new category to the DSM-5. Can you guess what they want to call it? If you guessed \u0026ldquo;severe autism\u0026rdquo;[5] you are right.\nReferences ^Vance, Terra (2018-09-10). \"Function Labels: And We’re Supposed to be The Awkward Ones\".

Apraxia Apraxia is having difficulty with voluntary movement, consisting of partial or total incapacity to execute purposeful movements, without impairment of muscular power, sensibility and coordination. The person has difficulty sequencing movements in the service of a goal. May be specific to speech. Alexithymia The inability to identify and describe emotions experienced by oneself. ASD The autism spectrum is a range of neurodevelopmental conditions generally characterized by difficulties in social interactions and communication, repetitive behaviors, intense interests, and unusual responses to sensory stimuli. It is commonly referred to as autism or, in the context of a professional diagnosis, autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Asperger's Syndrome (Aspie)* Hans Asperger is credited with identifying autism in the 1940's. The term was used to refer to a form of autism where the autistic person has less support needs and much lower impairment of language. The term has fallen out of use since it was recently uncovered that he played a critical role in identifying disabled children that were sent to be euthanized or subjected to experimentation. The term has been removed from the DSM-5 and is due to be removed from the ICD-11.[2] AT Assistive Technology: Electronic as well as non-electronic materials, equipment and devices designed to help people with disabilities play, learn, communicate, move around and carry out activities of daily living at home, at school, and in the community. AuDHD A person who has both Autism and ADHD. Autistic Ally This refers to a non-autistic person who makes a conscious decision to support the autistic community, fight for autistic rights, and work against the oppression of autistic people. Anyone has the potential to be an ally. An ally can use their privilege to be powerful voices alongside autistic people. DDF Difficulty Describing Feelings DIR Developmental, Individual Differences, Relationship-based (DIR): An intervention framework that helps clinicians, parents and educators conduct a comprehensive assessment and develop an intervention program tailored to the unique challenges and strengths. DSM The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual is a guide used by healthcare professionals when diagnosing various conditions. For each condition it details the symptoms or traits that must be present for a formal diagnosis to be given. It is reviewed and revised periodically and is currently on version 5. It is primarily used in the USA. Dyspraxia The brain’s inability to plan muscle movements and carry them out. Echolalia Repeating back something said to you. Delayed Echolalia is repeating it later. Both behaviors are found in many autistics. EF Executive function: The ability to plan, organize and follow through, as well as the ability to inhibit actions, delay responses, make appropriate choices and shift attention. Individuals with ASDs, learning disabilities and other neurological conditions often have deficits in executive function, which is important to the attainment of goals. EBI Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI): A fairly generic term for applied behavioral analysis (ABA-based) interventions, the focus is on very young children with ASD, usually younger than five, and often younger than three. The intensity of intervention is significant in number of hours and in the ratio of child to instructor. EOT Externally Oriented Thinking style HFA* High-functioning Autism (HFA): Although not officially recognized as a diagnostic category, HFA refers to individuals with ASDs who have near-average to above-average cognitive abilities and can communicate through receptive and expressive language. It has been highly criticized by the autistic community.[3] Hyperlexia A condition in which the main characteristics are an above average ability to read accompanied with a blow average ability to understand spoken language. ICD The International Classification of Diseases is the World Health Organisation’s guide to health conditions. It is used globally. It contains information on diagnosing conditions, as well as how to manage, monitor or treat them where appropriate. The ICD is reviewed and revised periodically and is currently on version 10. Unlike the DSM, this current version still lists Asperger’s Syndrome. However, this will be removed in ICD-11 which is due to be is implemented in January 2022. IEE Independent Education Evaluation (IEE): Assessment of a child requested by a parent who believes that the school did not conduct a proper evaluation. IFL The phrased “disabled people” is an example of identity-first language. IFL, in contrast to people-first language (PFL), is the preferred terminology in Great Britain and by a number of U.S. disability activists. The reason many autistic people dislike people-first language is that they consider autism to be an inseparable part of who they are.[4] Masking Masking involves an autistic person making changes to their behaviour to disguise autistic traits and seem more like their non-autistic peers. Another term used for this is camouflaging. Sometimes masking is a conscious choice in that moment. At other times, autistic people may not realise they are masking. ’Unmasking’ is not as simple as an autistic person deciding to stop masking. They will likely need to spend time relearning who they truly are and want to be. It involves changing instinctive habits and thought patterns that have been developed through masking and so it is a difficult process. Meltdown A meltdown can be the result of an overwhelming situation. It can be the result of intense emotions and/or stimuli that are overwhelming or difficult to cope with. A meltdown becomes the involuntary response to these emotions or stimuli. It is more visible to others than a shutdown as it involves an outward reaction. This could be a verbal and/or physical reaction such as crying, screaming, repetitive movements, throwing items or hitting out. Misophonia Misophonia is characterized by the experience of strong negative emotions of anger and anxiety in response to certain everyday sounds, such as those generated by other people eating, drinking, and breathing. Neurodiverse This term is used to describe people that experience life differently from the majority due to neurological differences – like autistic people. It acknowledges that there can be vast differences in the way people think, behave and process information. By focussing on ‘difference’ rather than ‘deficits’, it acknowledges that difference can be positive and it removes the stigma associated with being different from the majority. Another term used is ‘neuro-atypical’. Neurodiversity The variation and differences in neurological structure and function that exist among human beings. As a term, it refers to the idea that differences in brain development and behavior are normal and not the result of mental disorders. Neurotypical (NT) A term commonly used by supporters of Neurodiversity to describe a person who “shows typical neurological behavior and development.” It refers to a person that general society would consider to have an “average” or “normal” (typical) brain (NT). OCD Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. An anxiety disorder, that is characterized by recurrent, time-consuming obsessive or compulsive behaviors that cause distress. The obsessions may be repetitive intrusive images, thoughts, or impulses. ODD Oppositional Defiant Disorder is characterized by aggressiveness and a tendency to purposefully bother and irritate others as a recurrent pattern of negativistic behavior. OT Occupational Therapy or Occupational Therapist. A therapist that focuses on daily living skills, sensory integration, self-help skills, playing, adaptive behavior and fine motor skills. An Occupational therapists would provide Sensory Integration Therapy. PECS Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS): PECS is an alternative communication system that uses picture symbols. It is taught in six phases starting with a simple exchange of a picture symbol for a desired item. Individuals learn to use picture symbols to construct complete sentences, initiate communication, and answer direct questions. Perseverate Perseverate means “to repeat something insistently or redundantly.” Just like stimming, perseveration is not exclusive to people diagnosed with ASD, but it is a commonly observed behavior among that particular group. An example of perseveration would be repeatedly salting a piece of food until no salt is left in the container. PFL People-first language (PFL), also called person-first language, is a type of linguistic prescription which puts a person before a diagnosis, describing what condition a person \"has\" rather than asserting what a person \"is\". Proprioception Proprioception refers to a person’s awareness of where their body is positioned in their environment, and where their limits are in terms of their body and how much force is being applied to it. They can also struggle with how to regulate this. If people are hypo- or hypersensitive to this sense it will impact their coordination and how they interact with the world around them. Difficulties with fine motor skills are related to proprioception and this can impact a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks such as writing or using cutlery. Poor gross motor skills impact on coordination of the body in larger movements such as dancing or running. A person may also have difficulty with placing objects or avoiding objects when moving. SDAM Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory (SDAM) refers to a lifelong inability to vividly recollect or re-experience personal past events from a first-person perspective. Selective Mutism Selective mutism occurs where in certain situations a person becomes unable to speak. They may be able to speak verbally in some environments or to certain trusted people. However in others, anxiety or overwhelm can prevent the person from being able to speak. ‘Selective’ implies a choice but this is not the case. ‘Situational mutism’ has been suggested as a potential more appropriate term. Sensory Overload Sensory overload occurs when sensory stimuli in a person’s environment become too overwhelming. This refers to the seven senses of touch, taste, sound, sight, smell, vestibular and proprioception. It can be a very overwhelming and anxiety-inducing experience. The autistic person will likely feel a need to get away from the environment or situation that has led to overload but may need support to do this. Shutdown Like a meltdown, a shutdown is another type of response to overwhelming emotions and/or stimuli. During a shutdown, the autistic person withdraws (either partially or completely) from the environment. They may physically remove themselves to a space they consider safe, or they may freeze in the current place and though they want to leave they are not able to. They may stop responding to communication from others. SBC* Simon Baron-Cohen is a British clinical psychologist and professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge. He has often been criticized by the autistic community for many of his theories such as his \"extreme male brain\" theory of autism.[5] SI Sensory Integration (SI): This is a term applied to the way the brain processes sensory stimulation or sensation from the body and then translates that information into specific, planned and coordinated motor activity. Special Interest What differentiates this from a generic interest is the intensity of that interest. The topic of interest can be any subject at all, just as neurotypical people have a wide range of different interests. Some autistic people’s interests may draw more attention if they are not in line with neurotypical interests. Some autistic people keep the same interest throughout their life or for very long periods, whereas for others they may change more regularly. Spectrum As in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Many people picture the spectrum as a straight line, often with people that are perceived as needing more support on one end, and people perceived as needing less support on the other. This is not what was meant by the Autism Spectrum. The term spectrum was introduced to acknowledge that autistic people have difficulties or different experiences in common areas, but they are affected in different ways and to varying extents. Each autistic person’s experience is unique. SPED Special Education (SPED): Specialized and personalized instruction of a disabled child, designed in response to educational disabilities determined by an evaluation. Stimming Autistic people have described stimming as being repetitive or rhythmic behaviours. Common words autistic people use to describe the feeling of stimming are often soothing, calming and comforting. Stimming can reduce anxiety and help autistic people cope with overwhelming situations, environments, and thoughts. Stimming can also be the result of positive emotions such as excitement. TEACHH Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) Model: A program of services, rather than a teaching method, in which respect for individual differences, respect and inclusion of parents and various professionals and input from individuals with ASDs are considered in treatment and education. Developed at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and takes a lifespan approach. Theory Of Mind The ability to understand that others have beliefs, desires and intentions that are different from one’s own. Vestibular Sense This relates to sense of balance. Those experiencing hypersensitivity (awareness and experiences are heightened) may struggle to tolerate quick movements and could feel disorientated if, for example, jumping and leaving the ground. A person may appear ‘clumsy’, for example I lose my balance easily and this can lead to falls or accidents. Those with hyposensitivity (awareness and experiences are reduced), on the other hand, may gain pleasure from the feeling of movement and may not experience dizziness or nausea from activities such as spinning or swinging.

For example, in modern times, a common barrier that individuals with disabilities face deals with employment. Specifically, employers are often unwilling or unable to provide the necessary accommodations to enable individuals with disabilities to effectively carry out their job functions.[6]\nWhen having a discussion about the needs of persons with disabilities, disability activists note that solutions include persons with disabilities as active participants, at least to some extent. Current systems exist that involve third party involvement, such as mental rehabilitation and legal advocacy, but few of these methods include empowering this group to be self-sufficient.\nThe social model of disability suggests disability is caused by the way society is organized, rather than by a person\u0026rsquo;s impairment. This model suggests barriers in society are created by ableism. When barriers are removed, people with disabilities can be independent and equal in society.\nThere are three main types of barriers:[13]\nAttitudinal barriers: are created by people who see only disability when associating with people with disabilities in some way. These attitudinal barriers can be witnessed through bullying, discrimination, and fear. These barriers include low expectations of people with disabilities. These barriers contribute to all other barriers.[13][14][15] Attitudes towards people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries can be even more extreme.[16] Environmental barriers: inaccessible environments, natural or built, create disability by creating barriers to inclusion. Institutional barriers: include many laws, policies, practices, or strategies that discriminate against people with disabilities. For example, a study of five Southeast Asian countries found that electoral laws do not specially protect the political rights of persons with disabilities, while \u0026ldquo;some banks do not allow visually disabled people to open accounts, and HIV testing centers often refuse to accept sign language interpreters due to confidentiality policies\u0026rdquo;.[17] Restrictive laws exist in some countries, particularly affecting people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.[18] Other barriers include: internalised barriers (low expectations of people with disabilities can undermine their confidence and aspirations), inadequate data and statistics, lack of participation and consultation of disabled people.\nDisability etiquette is a set of guidelines dealing specifically with how to approach a person with a disability.\nLinguistic prescription is the establishment of rules defining preferred usage of language.\nDistancing describes the process by which psychologists help a person establish their own individuality through understanding their separateness from everything around them.\nPeople-first language is a type of linguistic prescription. It aims to avoid perceived and subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities and is sometimes referred to (e.g. by NHS England\u0026rsquo;s style guide) as a type of disability etiquette. People-first language can also be applied to any group that is defined by a condition rather than as a people: for example, \u0026ldquo;those that are homeless\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;the homeless.\u0026rdquo;\nRather than using labels to define individuals with a health issue, it is more appropriate to use terminology that describes individuals as being diagnosed with an illness or disorder. People first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person has not what the person is.[2]\nThe basic idea is to use a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example, \u0026ldquo;people with disabilities\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;disabled people\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;disabled,\u0026rdquo; to emphasize that they are people first. Because it is a common practice in English to place an adjective before a noun, the adjective might be replaced with a relative clause, e.g., from \u0026ldquo;an asthmatic person\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;a person who has asthma.\u0026rdquo;\nBy using such a sentence structure, the speaker articulates the idea of a disability as a secondary attribute, not a characteristic of a person\u0026rsquo;s identity.\nLanguage is constantly changing and evolving, especially in the area of disability. There can be tension between the various groups of disability influencers concerning what language should be used. For example, parents of the disabled, researchers, and disability activists may each try to persuade society as a whole to adopt their specific perspective. The linguistic changes that end up getting adopted for each disability group shape how individuals both view and treat them. Sometimes a consensus over specific disability language is never reached.\nWhen speaking to an autistic person it is always best to ask them what language they prefer. For instance, I just used \u0026ldquo;autistic person\u0026rdquo; in my last sentence. Why didn\u0026rsquo;t I use a \u0026ldquo;person with autism\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;person who has autism\u0026rdquo;? And hey, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t I know it\u0026rsquo;s now called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?\u0026rdquo;. Good questions! I was using what is called \u0026ldquo;Identity-First Language\u0026rdquo; (IFL) instead of \u0026ldquo;Person-First Language\u0026rdquo; (PFL). So what\u0026rsquo;s the difference?\nPerson-First Language (PFL) The person-first language (PFL) movement started around 1974\nIn the autism community, many self-advocates and their allies prefer terminology such as \u0026ldquo;Autistic,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Autistic person,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Autistic individual\u0026rdquo; because we understand autism as an inherent part of an individual’s identity\u0026hellip;It is impossible to affirm the value and worth of an Autistic person without recognizing his or her identity as an Autistic person. Referring to me as \u0026ldquo;a person with autism,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;an individual with ASD\u0026rdquo; demeans who I am because it denies who I am\u0026hellip;When we say \u0026ldquo;person with autism,\u0026rdquo; we say that it is unfortunate and an accident that a person is Autistic. We affirm that the person has value and worth, and that autism is entirely separate from what gives him or her value and worth. In fact, we are saying that autism is detrimental to value and worth as a person, which is why we separate the condition with the word \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;has.\u0026rdquo; Ultimately, what we are saying when we say \u0026ldquo;person with autism\u0026rdquo; is that the person would be better off if not Autistic, and that it would have been better if he or she had been born typical.\n\u0026ndash;Lydia Brown, 2012[1]\nLet’s get one thing clear: Everyone has the right to define themselves in whatever way feels best and most authentic to them.Everyone has the right to define themselves in whatever way feels best and most authentic to them.\n\u0026ndash;Alex Capitan, 2017[2]\nTest[1]\nTest[2]\nCourtesy of Someone The truth may be puzzling.
