I was bored so I clicked on the link. It took me to an autism screening test called, The Autism Spectrum Quotient or AQ for short. The test consists of 50 questions. The average score people get is around 16. Eighty percent of those diagnosed with autism score 32 percent or higher. So I took the test. At the end it computes your score. Out came my result…43!\n This test is flawed!!\nMy Reaction To My Test Results\n Whaaaat??? I was incredulous. “This test is flawed!!”, I said to myself. So I went searching for other online autism screening tests and took those like the RAADS-R. All of them came back the same. “You should get tested for autism”, they all said. So I started researching autism. The only thing I knew about it was from watching tv or movies. Autistic savants like in the movie Rain Man was what I thought autism was. Spoiler alert, I’m not a savant. After reading about the main characteristics of autism and the actual diagnosis criteria found in the DSM-V I knew the tests were correct.\nIn this past year I have been diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and General Anxiety Disorder. I am 58. In addition, I deal with insomnia, misophonia, alexithymia and memory and sensory issues.\n But remember, you haven\u0026rsquo;t changed.\nFamily and Friends\n I have had both family and friends tell me, “but remember, you haven’t changed”. But that’s not true. I have changed, and I’ve changed a lot! How I view my whole life history has changed. My understanding of who I am and my identity has changed. My family and friends whom I have disclosed my diagnosis to have changed as well. Now my “quirks” are more clearly understood. And I have finally found answers to the many questions I have had about myself my entire life.\nLearning From Other Autistics In addition, I now have an entire community of other autistic people I can hang out with online who experience things like I do. And they have been teaching me how to take better care of myself. I also have found a whole new set of special interests for me to enjoy.\nTalk about change. What a year!\n","date":"July 20, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-5_hu5794fd58c9652be1e67c33374ee2e163_899991_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/blog/my-late-autism-diagnosis/","title":"My Autism Diagnosis in My Late 50’s"},{"categories":null,"contents":"My whole life I have struggled with the loudness of music and sounds. While at a movie or concert I often resort to putting both of my hands over my ears. I will look around and wonder why I am the only one in this large group of people that it bothers. How can they not hear how LOUD it is? Sensitivity to sounds also affects our sleep at night. Many of us suffer from insomnia.\nI’m also sensitive to light and prefer to sit in the dark. Since I work from home, I will go through the house and turn off all of the lights when my family leaves for the day. I use dark-mode on my computer and I reverse black and white colors by using a black background with green or white text.\nMany Autistic people have to deal with sensory issues. Since each person is unique, there can be different reactions to similar sensory inputs. Some experience hypersensitivity while others hyposensitivity (under-responsiveness), and still others a mixture of both. Sensory issues are also cited as a requirement for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the DSM-V.\n Hyper- or hypo- reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment.\nDSM-5\n Sensory issues can affect any of our eight senses: visual (sight), auditory (sounds), olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile (touch), and the three senses that often get left out, vestibular (balance), proprioception (sensations from muscles/joints), and interoception (internal sensations like thirst and hunger).\nLearning What Works For You Each individual autistic must learn what works best for them to manage their sensory issues. There are products that offer help for more common issues. For example, the advent of noise cancelling headphones has been a godsend for autistic people. We can now eliminate all of the external sounds that can be so intrusive to us. There are also ear plugs that can filter a lot of background sounds. And some soft ones designed to be worn while sleeping at night. There are sunglasses that help with bright light and weighted blankets that provide sleep support as well as reducing anxiety.\n","date":"June 5, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-4_hu29c327de23bd7b2fdbef79c7b406827f_339444_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/blog/autism-and-sensory-issues/","title":"Autism and Sensory Issues"},{"categories":null,"contents":"There are many routines that I find myself doing. From wearing the same grey shirt every day to eating the same food. I will listen to the same song on repeat for days at a time.\nDiagnostic Criteria One of the primary diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as described in the DSM-5 is that the individual shows restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.\n We prefer to have our daily routines so that we know what is going to happen each day.\n Surviving Chaos I think the reason we engage in these behaviors is that to an autistic person the world is a very unpredictable and often confusing place. We prefer to have our daily routines so that we know what is going to happen each day. For me that includes things like traveling the same route to and from a common destination, or eating exactly the same food for breakfast. These routines and sameness help me navigate a chaotic and uncertain world.\n","date":"April 16, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-3_hu0ffa119e59e5067f86765bedf83f9d3f_33166_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/blog/autism-and-routines/","title":"Autism and Routines"},{"categories":null,"contents":"One Autistic trait that I have is the ability to hyperfocus on something that I am really interested in. While many Autistic people share this ability not all of us do. I’m reminded of a saying we like to use, “If you’ve met one Autistic person, you’ve met one Autistic person”. This means that we are all different, and though we might have some shared characteristics, many could be different.\nLearning New Skills I’ve used the ability to hyperfocus to learn new skills in a really short amount of time. I will typically bombard my brain 24-7 with the new information I am trying to learn. I am able to deeply concentrate to the point where everything outside of what I’m doing simply fades away. This has enabled me to accomplish many important goals in my life. One example is that I was able to completely change my career in less than six months.\nSome Drawbacks However, it is not without its drawbacks. Being in a state of hyperfocus means I often can’t respond when someone is trying to get my attention. This means I may appear to be rude or aloof. When I was in college and was walking across the campus, I would often be lost in thought. People would tell me that they saw me walking and had hollered out my name and tried to get my attention but I didn’t respond. This is an example where my hyperfocusing affected someone’s opinion of me or worse, caused hurt feelings.\nAutism in the Media The media likes to share stories about Autistic people with extraordinary abilities in math, science, or the arts. This sort of focus tends to minimize the real struggles Autistic people have by implying we all have some great gift we can rely on. Some Autistic people may have unique gifts but many of us do not. I happen to be one of the lucky ones in that regard, but many are not. Yes, some Autistic people may talk about an ability they have as their “super-power” but please don’t get the wrong idea. If the stereotype of the Autistic savant with an extraordinary ability continues to be the main narrative pushed by the media, it can be used to minimize the real struggles Autistic people go through every day.\n","date":"April 2, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-1_hufdb9bb88432846b1ebccf10840943453_362306_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/blog/autism-and-hyperfocus/","title":"Autism and Hyperfocus"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I got my Autistic diagnosis late last year as an older adult. Many years prior I was a piano teacher with my own piano studio. I had many types of students, from beginners to advanced and I taught both young and old. Two of my younger students had disabilities. One was an Autistic boy I’ll call Steven and the other a blind girl I’ll call Olivia. I had an immediate connection with both students. We just seemed to be in sync. I had never taught anyone with a disability before, but I seemed to intuitively know how best to go about teaching them. Looking back at it now I realize that my own Autistic communication system was somehow in sync with both of theirs.\nSteven I always knew when Steven had arrived at our home for his lesson because I’d hear ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong\u0026hellip;knock-knock-knock-knock at the door. I’d welcome Steven and his Mother into our home and after catching up for a bit, Steven and I would head to the piano. Steven was a lot of fun to teach. He could speak, but a lot of his speech consisted of cartoon phrases he had learned from television.\n Oh well, back to the drawing board!\nSteven\n For instance, if he made a mistake while playing a piece he might say, “Oh well, back to the drawing board.” or, “That’s despicable!”. Steven always played with great accuracy because of his musical ear and ability to memorize his pieces quickly. He would first listen to me play a new piece for him and then we would begin working on it together. At the end of each lesson we would play his favorite musical game which consisted of me playing chords on the piano for him to identify by ear. He would instantly tell me if a chord was major, minor, diminished, or augmented and would use the correct technical term when identifying them.\nOlivia I would drive over to Olivia’s house each week for her piano lesson. She would greet me at the door eager for the lesson to begin. I always brought with me a recording I had prepared for her to use for that weeks practice. I recorded any new songs for her to listen to with instructions on how to practice them. She would lead me to the piano where we would begin. Olivia had an amazing ear and memory. She would rock back and forth on the piano bench as she played through her pieces with great musical understanding. She also enjoyed composing her own music. Sometimes she had written lyrics for her composition and would sing along while she played for me. I would always encourage her to compose more.\n","date":"April 2, 2022","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/blog/post-2_huf6f0ac947ab78cae940c8e88ec9c8007_129508_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/blog/autism-in-sync/","title":"In Sync"},{"categories":null,"contents":"About: Autastic exists as a home for the uncounted legion of adults worldwide who learned, well into adulthood, that they are (or might be) autistic.

After being around the autistic community for a while, you will come across the use of functioning labels.\nKat Williams in her National Center for Mental Health article writes:\n Functioning labels, though not a diagnostic tool, are allocated arbitrarily to identify someone’s communication methods and intellectual ability: those labelled ‘high functioning’ typically have no speech or language delay (or the delay is not significant), communicate through speech, and have normal to high intellect; and those labelled ‘low functioning’ typically do not use spoken language, instead using an alternative form of communication such as a picture exchange system (PECS), sign, or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), and/or have an intellectual disability.\n  For those labelled high functioning, it can be incredibly difficult to get external support once diagnosed.\n  \u0026lsquo;High functioning’ is not how an autistic person experiences being autistic, it’s how society experiences the autistic person.\n DSM-V The American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) in 2013. In the United States and many other countries, the DSM-V is the reference guide healthcare professionals use to diagnose autism and other mental and behavioral conditions. It contains three different \u0026ldquo;severity\u0026rdquo; levels of autism with the highest level three requiring \u0026ldquo;very substantial support\u0026rdquo;.\nProblems With Functioning Labels  Labels Don\u0026rsquo;t Reflect Reality: Autistic people\u0026rsquo;s abilities to function constantly change. Everyone has had a bad day where they can barely do anything. Autistic people are no different, and their abilities to function often fluctuate dramatically during a single day. Labels Limit Who Gets Accomodations: Unless you are considered \u0026ldquo;low functioning\u0026rdquo; then automatically your accomodation needs will get ignored. It assumes \u0026ldquo;low functioning\u0026rdquo; people lack intelligence so they get denied opportunities, and \u0026ldquo;high functioning\u0026rdquo; people are assumed to be normal and denied support. Labels Are Not Helpful: Slapping a label on someone does not tell you anything useful about their specific needs. Labels Are Often Ableist: Instead of accepting people how they are, people are taught to believe being disabled is bad. So being labeled \u0026ldquo;high functioning\u0026rdquo; must be much better than \u0026ldquo;low functioning\u0026rdquo;. Labels Divide Us: People can use labels as a means to silence autistic voices they don\u0026rsquo;t approve of.  Studies Show Functioning Labels Are Harmful Recent studies have shown that:\n high cognitive “function” had no connection to high function in other areas of life — an autistic person with high cognitive abilities can struggle significantly socially or emotionally.\n In 2022 People Are Still Trying To Use Them The National Council On Severe Autism (NCSA) wants to add a new category to the DSM-5. Can you guess what they want to call it? If you guessed \u0026ldquo;Severe Autism\u0026rdquo; you are right.\n","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://autism-101.com/images/avatar/03_hu40b86ca66b19642cc2b38ce757cc8bba_35379_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/autism-functioning-labels/","title":"Autism Functioning Labels"},{"categories":null,"contents":"How can I help you?
