<h2 class="h3 mb-3">Autistic Adults Overview</h2>
{{< newtabref  href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2036299673287000/" title="Autistic Adults" >}} has over 8 thousand members. Every person is welcome here no matter their religion, political views, colour of their skin, gender, or lifestyle choice. They accept all ASD adults. They accept self-diagnosis and professional diagnosis. Denial of the validity of a person's form of diagnosis will result in a ban. 

Some of the posting rules include: 

* No mention of functioning labels--High or Low Functioning Autistic--are permitted in this group. Autism is a spectrum and Functioning Labels are not an accurate reflection of this and are harmful to the community.
* Aspergers has been removed from most medical diagnostic systems, and the condition has been rolled into Autism Spectrum Disorder. It also carries significant negative implications. As a result, the use of the term is also not permitted. No using things like A$perg*rs to dodge this.
* Add... (TW) ([Topic of trigger]) . . . ...to the beginning of any post that is likely to cause distress to others.
* No selling or advertising.
