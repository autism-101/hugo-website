##### Overview

* No promoting the medical model - No person first language, no functioning labels, no pathologising of traits, no support of neurotypical charities, no defending the Asperger's label, no promoting ABA. 
* No punching down, minority voices come first - If you are in a position of power or privilege, do not try and speak over those with less, just as neurotypicals should not speak over autistics, majority autistic do not get a louder voice.
* Respect the privacy of the group - No screenshots can be shared outside of the group, no member can be exposed as a member, nothing from inside the group should be shared or discussed outside of the group.
* Accessibility is a must - If you are asked to add image descriptions, or to remove inaccessible backgrounds, you are required to do so. Modmins will write descriptions for you to add where possible.
