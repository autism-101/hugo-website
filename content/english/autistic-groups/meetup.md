<h2 class="h3 mb-3">About Meetup:</h2>
{{< newtabref  href="https://www.meetup.com/" title="Meetup" >}} does have some autistic support groups and it is worth doing a search for groups in your area to see if there is one near you. 

One example meetup group is the {{< newtabref  href="https://www.meetup.com/dfwasg/" title="DFW Autistic Support Group" >}} which is an informal group that offers advocacy, support, and social opportunities for autistic adults and adolescents in the Dallas and Fort Worth area in Texas.

Though {{< newtabref  href="https://www.meetup.com/dfwasg/" title="DFW Autistic Support Group" >}} meetings are more focused on autism, neurodivergent and allistic allies are always welcome to attend.

They also provide open forums on many other platforms like Facebook and Discord, and are always looking into new ways to support the community!
