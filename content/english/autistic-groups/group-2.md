##### About:
Quite simply, {{< newtabref  href="https://auticomm.mn.co/" title="AutiComm" >}} it's an emergent peer-to-peer community of autistic folks. 

It's a space by autistics for autistics - to chat about interests, poke the hive mind for advice, collaborate on projects, and who even knows what other fantastical undertakings this space will launch.

##### Overview
{{< newtabref  href="https://auticomm.mn.co/" title="AutiComm" >}} is an autistic community made by us and for us, intended to both incubate connection among autie folks and launch projects towards greater public connection. It is part of the {{< newtabref  href="https://www.mightynetworks.com" title="Mighty Networks" >}} online community system which has built-in features such as direct messages, and community discussion threads based on categories.
