In this past year I have been diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and General Anxiety Disorder. I am 58. In addition, I deal with insomnia, misophonia, alexithymia and memory and sensory issues.

I have had both family and friends tell me, “but remember, **you** haven’t changed”. But that’s not true. I have changed, and I’ve changed a lot! How I view my whole life history has changed. My understanding of who I am and my identity has changed. My family and friends whom I have disclosed my diagnosis to have changed as well. Now my “quirks” are more clearly understood. And I have finally found answers to the many questions I have had about myself my entire life.

#### Learning From Other Autistics
In addition, I now have an entire community of other autistic people I can hang out with online who experience things like I do. And they have been teaching me how to take better care of myself. I also have found a whole new set of special interests for me to enjoy. 

Talk about change. What a year!
