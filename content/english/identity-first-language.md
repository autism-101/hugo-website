##### Why Language Matters

The disability rights movement is a global[1][2][3] social movement that seeks to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for all people with disabilities.

It is made up of organizations of disability activists, also known as disability advocates, around the world working together with similar goals and demands, such as: accessibility and safety in architecture, transportation, and the physical environment; equal opportunities in independent living, employment equity, education, and housing; and freedom from discrimination, abuse, neglect, and from other rights violations.[4] Disability activists are working to break institutional, physical, and societal barriers that prevent people with disabilities from living their lives like other citizens.[4][5]

Disability rights is complex because there are multiple ways in which a person with a disability can have their rights violated in different socio-political, cultural, and legal contexts. For example, in modern times, a common barrier that individuals with disabilities face deals with employment. Specifically, employers are often unwilling or unable to provide the necessary accommodations to enable individuals with disabilities to effectively carry out their job functions.[6]

When having a discussion about the needs of persons with disabilities, disability activists note that solutions include persons with disabilities as active participants, at least to some extent. Current systems exist that involve third party involvement, such as mental rehabilitation and legal advocacy, but few of these methods include empowering this group to be self-sufficient.

The social model of disability suggests disability is caused by the way society is organized, rather than by a person's impairment. This model suggests barriers in society are created by ableism. When barriers are removed, people with disabilities can be independent and equal in society.

There are three main types of barriers:[13]

Attitudinal barriers: are created by people who see only disability when associating with people with disabilities in some way. These attitudinal barriers can be witnessed through bullying, discrimination, and fear. These barriers include low expectations of people with disabilities. These barriers contribute to all other barriers.[13][14][15] Attitudes towards people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries can be even more extreme.[16]
Environmental barriers: inaccessible environments, natural or built, create disability by creating barriers to inclusion.
Institutional barriers: include many laws, policies, practices, or strategies that discriminate against people with disabilities. For example, a study of five Southeast Asian countries found that electoral laws do not specially protect the political rights of persons with disabilities, while "some banks do not allow visually disabled people to open accounts, and HIV testing centers often refuse to accept sign language interpreters due to confidentiality policies".[17] Restrictive laws exist in some countries, particularly affecting people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.[18]
Other barriers include: internalised barriers (low expectations of people with disabilities can undermine their confidence and aspirations), inadequate data and statistics, lack of participation and consultation of disabled people.


Disability etiquette is a set of guidelines dealing specifically with how to approach a person with a disability.

Linguistic prescription is the establishment of rules defining preferred usage of language.

Distancing describes the process by which psychologists help a person establish their own individuality through understanding their separateness from everything around them.

People-first language is a type of linguistic prescription. It aims to avoid perceived and subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities and is sometimes referred to (e.g. by NHS England's style guide) as a type of disability etiquette. People-first language can also be applied to any group that is defined by a condition rather than as a people: for example, "those that are homeless" rather than "the homeless."

Rather than using labels to define individuals with a health issue, it is more appropriate to use terminology that describes individuals as being diagnosed with an illness or disorder. People first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person has not what the person is.[2]

The basic idea is to use a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example, "people with disabilities" rather than "disabled people" or "disabled," to emphasize that they are people first. Because it is a common practice in English to place an adjective before a noun, the adjective might be replaced with a relative clause, e.g., from "an asthmatic person" to "a person who has asthma."

By using such a sentence structure, the speaker articulates the idea of a disability as a secondary attribute, not a characteristic of a person's identity.

<div class="col"><p>Language is constantly changing and evolving, especially in the area of disability. There can be tension between the various groups of disability influencers concerning what language should be used. For example, parents of the disabled, researchers, and disability activists may each try to persuade society as a whole to adopt their specific perspective. The linguistic changes that end up getting adopted for each disability group shape how individuals both view and treat them. Sometimes a consensus over specific disability language is never reached.</p></div>

When speaking to an autistic person it is always best to ask them what language they prefer. For instance, I just used "autistic person" in my last sentence. Why didn't I use a "person with autism" or a "person who has autism"? And hey, "Don't I know it's now called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?". Good questions! I was using what is called "Identity-First Language" (IFL) instead of "Person-First Language" (PFL). So what's the difference?


##### Person-First Language (PFL)

The person-first language (PFL) movement started around 1974 

>In the autism community, many self-advocates and their allies prefer terminology such as "Autistic," "Autistic person," or "Autistic individual" because we understand autism as an inherent part of an individual’s identity...It is impossible to affirm the value and worth of an Autistic person without recognizing his or her identity as an Autistic person. Referring to me as "a person with autism," or "an individual with ASD" demeans who I am because it denies who I am...When we say "person with autism," we say that it is unfortunate and an accident that a person is Autistic. We affirm that the person has value and worth, and that autism is entirely separate from what gives him or her value and worth. In fact, we are saying that autism is detrimental to value and worth as a person, which is why we separate the condition with the word "with" or "has." Ultimately, what we are saying when we say "person with autism" is that the person would be better off if not Autistic, and that it would have been better if he or she had been born typical.
