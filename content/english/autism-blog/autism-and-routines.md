There are many routines that I find myself doing. From wearing the same grey shirt every day to eating the same food. I will listen to the same song on repeat for days at a time. 

<h2 class="h4 mb-4">Diagnostic Criteria</h2>
One of the primary diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as described in the DSM-5  is that the individual shows restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. 

> We prefer to have our daily routines so that we know what is going to happen each day.

<h2 class="h4 mb-4">Surviving Chaos</h2>
I think the reason we engage in these behaviors is that to an autistic person the world is a very unpredictable and often confusing place. We prefer to have our daily routines so that we know what is going to happen each day. For me that includes things like traveling the same route to and from a common destination, or eating exactly the same food for breakfast. These routines and sameness help me navigate a chaotic and uncertain world.
